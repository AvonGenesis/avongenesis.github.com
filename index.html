      Hi, I'm Julian.
      I'm a student at Cal Poly Pomona, majoring in Computer Science, with plans
      to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Winter 2017.
      I'm a full stack web developer. My framework of choice is Ruby on Rails.
      On this website you will find a list of projects that I have worked on.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Rawr Chat <span class="sub-heading">PHP webchat</span></h3>
    <div>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="https://github.com/AvonGenesis/rawr_chat">Source</a>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="http://rawrchat.juliantith.com">Demo</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Rawr Chat is a webchat built using PHP and MySQL. The design for the
      chatroom is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durarara!!">Durarara!!</a> I have been working on this since
      June 2012 as a hobby making updates whenever I can. I really liked the
      design of the chatroom from the show and wanted to make it a reality.
      There are similar chatrooms out there that have the same design, but I
      built this webchat with a focus on user customization. Users are currently
      able to select a custom color scheme for their chat bubble and avatar
      background. Custom avatars is something I would like to add
      in the future.

    <h3>Detour App <span class="sub-heading">Tour planning made easy</span></h3>
    <div>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="http://devpost.com/software/detour-app">Devpost</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Band tour planning software. This web application is targeted towards bands
      that are planning their tour. By telling Detour your start and destination
      location, it will plan out a route that has the most venues that you can
      perform at while also taking into account fuel costs and potential
      revenue gains from playing at certain venues. By utilizing the Eventful
      API, we are able to gather a list of venues you can play at along your
      planned route and beautifully display it using the Google Maps API.
      This project was made using the Laravel 5 framework with a MySQL database.
      Our team made this project for Hackpoly 2015.

    <h3>AlarmUp <span class="sub-heading">Making your alarm smart</a></h3>
    <div>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="http://devpost.com/software/alarmup">Devpost</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Smart alarm clock web application. This project was built using the Ruby
      on Rails framework and is powered by the IBM Watson API. Built for LAHacks
      2015, our team envisioned this web application of replacing your old dumb
      alarm clock. Using the IBM Watson API, it would sift through your social
      networks and pull up the most interesting social news and read it off to
      you as well as pull any weather/local news.

    <h3>KoClass <span class="sub-heading">Communication platform for students and teachers<span></h3>
    <div>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="http://devpost.com/software/koclass-ruke6q">Devpost</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Built for HackingEDU 2015, this web application was developed as a
      platform for students and teachers to communicate about the class in real
      time. Teachers can add students to classrooms and manage them from there,
      when class is in sessions, students will have the ability to give live
      feedback on how the course is being taught and ask any questions
      they have available. Use cases can be geared towards online-only classes
      or in person classes. It is built using the Laravel 5 framework powered
      by the Moxtra API.

    <h3>Mosaifai <span class="sub-heading">Computer generated mosaic of similar images</span></h3>
    <div>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-ghost" href="http://devpost.com/software/mosaifai-b284vm">Devpost</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Made for Hackpoly 2016, Mosaifai is a mosaic generator. By providing a
      source image, it will find images of objects that are in the source image
      and create a mosaic of the original image using images that it finds
      across the internet. Built using PHP for the backend web service,
      Clarifai for image recognition, and Flickr for pooling images. Backend
      processing is handled by Sidekiq with ImageMagick for converting image
      sizes.
